# golf-weather-app

This is my first app using an API. 

I used the Openweathermap API to load current weather conditions for a selected city. I used HTML, vanilla CSS and JS. I used 3 seperate JS files to help organise the code.
The fetch.js file retrieves the data from the Openweathermap. The ui.js file manipulates the html file and loads the data to the browser. The app.js file adds the eventlisteners
to allow you to submit the search by either clicking the submit button or pressing the enter key on the keyboard. And finally, it also store local data in order to save the last
search request. 

This was my first app using an API. The main challenges revloved around javascript. This was the first time I had saved to local storage or used an event listener to allow
you to submit by using the enter key. There are many resources explaining theses processes and I used MDN, stackoverflow and my udemy bootcamp course notes to help me 
address these requirements.
